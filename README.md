1. task1: '
Prediction using Supervised MLIn this task, 
we have to develop a model to predict the percentage of marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours he/she studied.
This is implemented using Simple Linear Regression involving 2 variables.
2. task2:
Prediction using Unsupervised ML
In this task, we have to develop a classifier for the 'Iris' dataset and predict an optimum numbers of clusters and thus viusalizing them.
3. task3:
Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
In this EDA task, we have to clean the data and visualize the same using different methods in order to derive meaningful insights beneficial for the business.
